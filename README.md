Bamboo standardizes the acquisition, storage, and presentation of data generated in biophysical research. 
It does NOT facilitate the *analysis* of data in an effort to be application-independent.

 Acquisition
 -----------
 Lab notebook for logging protocols, experimental parameters, etc. 
 Design a template that aggregates image data, figures, plots, experimental parameters, etc.
 
 Presentaton 
 -----------
 Use built-in figure templates, metrics, and matplotlib wrappers to create publication-quality plots
 
 Storage
 -------
 Reading and writing to databases for efficient storage and retrieval of data
